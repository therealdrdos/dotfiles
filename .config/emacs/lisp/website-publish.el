;;; website-publish.el --- Org‑publish setup for my static site -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; This package provides org-publish configuration for generating a static
;; website with blog functionality, RSS feed, and plain-text export.
;; Source: https://github.com/therealdrdos/simonswebsite
;;
;; Features:
;; - Dynamic website root detection (works from any subdirectory)
;; - Custom HTML templating with placeholder substitution
;; - Automatic blog index generation with descriptions and dates
;; - RSS feed with configurable URLs
;; - Plain-text export with ANSI color codes for terminal viewing
;; - Performance-optimized with memoized directory lookups
;;
;; Directory Structure:
;;   website-root/
;;   ├── template.html          (required: HTML template with {{placeholders}})
;;   ├── src/                   (Org source files)
;;   │   ├── index.org
;;   │   └── blog/
;;   │       └── posts/*.org    (Blog posts with #+TITLE, #+DESCRIPTION, #+FILETAGS)
;;   ├── static/                (CSS, images, etc.)
;;   └── site/                  (Generated HTML output)
;;
;; Workflow:
;; 1. Navigate to your website directory (or any subdirectory within it)
;; 2. Run: M-x org-publish RET website RET
;; 3. The package automatically finds template.html to determine the root
;; 4. All components (pages, posts, RSS, static, txt) are published
;;
;; Configuration:
;; Customize these variables to adapt to your setup:
;; - `my/site-url': Base URL of your website
;; - `my/rss-avatar-url': Avatar image URL for RSS feed
;;
;; Advanced:
;; - `my/site-root-reset': Clear cached root (useful after changing directories)
;; - `my/website-publish-mode-disable': Disable automatic root detection
;; - `my/website-publish-force': Force-publish all files (ignores cache)
;;
;; Cache Behavior:
;; - Automatic cleanup when entire site/ directory is deleted
;; - Individual deleted files: use M-x my/website-publish-force or C-u M-x org-publish
;;
