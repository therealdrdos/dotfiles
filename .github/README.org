This is the place where I store my personal config files. I manage them via [[yadm][https://yadm.io/]].

* Rights to use
Feel free to include the dotfiles in your projects or to get inspiration from them. However, I won't provide any warranty on the quality of them.
They are my personal files and I try to keep them up to date with general security/implementation recommendations, but there is no guarantee on that.
